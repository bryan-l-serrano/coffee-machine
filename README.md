# coffee-machine

This is the python script I wrote to control a coffee machine from a raspberry pi
by sending a signal from the pi to a relay that allows for the coffee machine to 
turn on and then stop running after a specified time in seconds. if no time is specified as a parameter in the terminal,
it defaults to 10 minutes ( or 600 seconds)
